# bilt

bilt is a 3D graphics engine written in C using Vulkan. I will be adding to this over time as I learn Vulkan. This is for personal learning, experimenting, and project building.

Currently implementing non graphical engine features:
- Custom logging and outputs
- Custom error handling
- Custom memory allocation
- Custom platform specific APIs (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.)
- Clocks and Application Loops
- Test environment
