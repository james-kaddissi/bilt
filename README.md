# bilt

bilt is a 3D graphics engine written in C using Vulkan. I will be adding to this over time as I learn Vulkan. This is for personal learning, experimenting, and project building.

Here is a brief explanation of the structure of the engine. The directory "test-engine" is the game placeholder. It is an arbitrary game I'm using to test the engine. So this portion of the repository would be replaced with whatever game is being built. The "bilt-engine" directory contains the actual engine. Inside its split into the main layer, the platform layer, and the renderer layer. The platform layer provides the platform specific code needed to make the main layer function independent of platform. Development of the engine AND of games on the engine is entirely cross platform. The renderer layer has a backend and a frontend, with the frontend being entirely separate from the specific graphics API code. Inside their respective directories is the deployment code for the different graphics libraries(Vulkan only for now, but OpenGL and DirectX support to come), and the renderer frontend deals with configuring which backend type to initialize the renderer with (along with also initializing the actual functionality of the renderer).
